> Map of nouns to their irregular plural form

> An irregular plural in this library is defined as a noun that cannot be made plural by applying these rules:
> - If the noun ends in an "s", "x", "z", "ch" or "sh", add "es"
> - If the noun ends in a "y" and is preceded by a consonant, drop the "y" and add "ies"
> - If the noun ends in a "y" and is preceded by a vowel, add "s"

The list is just a [JSON file](irregular-plurals.json) and can be used anywhere.
